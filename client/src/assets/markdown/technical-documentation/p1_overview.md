 # Overview of technical documentation

> Technical documentation is different from app documentation. The former is for software engineers; the latter is for end users.

## 1. High-quality technical documentation is important

- A fellow software engineer with reasonable skills can learn the functions, workflow, data structure, and business logics of a web app.
- An app owner/backup owner can use the documentation as a reference to service the app.
    - Periodic upgrades (e.g. Angular upgrade every 6 months)
    - Feature enhancements
    - Bug fixes

## 2. Suggested technical documentation contents

- High-level overview and main app functions.
- App workflow
- Hierarchic (tree) data structure with data fields. For example: policy &rarr; property coverage &rarr; buildings
- Data flow: how data are loaded from a database or saved to a database from the front end?
- External API calls
- Complex business logics, math formulas... anything warranting attention from a fellow software engineer

## 3. Comprehensiveness, details, and brevity

Apps are constantly evolving with many enhancements being added regularly.

- Documentation that is too complex, too detailed will cost way too much time and effort to maintain.
- Details quickly become obsolete as the app evolves.
- Strike a balance between comprehensiveness, details, and bevity.
