We often need to perform calculations and implement business logics using data saved in a Reactive Form. The following design pattern is recommended:

- A master reactive form, which often comprises of hierarchic child forms, are defined in a Form Factory Service and injected into various components for consumption. For example:
  - At the top level, there is an insurance policy with policy-level attributes such as policy number, customer number, policy effective date, etc.
  - Under a policy, there are multiple coverages such as property, general liability, etc., each with their own coverage-specific data fields.
  - Under property coverage, there are multiple locations with location-level attributes such as city, state, etc.
  - Under a location, there are multiple buildings with building-level attributes such as construction type, year built, etc.

A(Policy):::cell --> B(Property Coverage):::cell --> C(Location):::cell --> D(Building):::cell
```

- The master reactive form is consumed by multiple components and their children, each rendering a part of the form in the UI. For example:
  - A property component renders an array of location child components.
  - An auto component renders an array of vechile child components.
- The Form Factory Service &rarr; Components setup ensures two things:
  - The underlying Reactive Form remains intact even after a component is destroyed on navigating away, because the form is provided by the Form Factory Service.
  - All components share the same underlying master Reactive Form. *Changes effected on the master Reactive Form by one component is reflected in all components*.
- A user can enter/edit data in the form. Form data can also be populated/changed by an API call to a database or a 3rd party vendor.
- Calculations/business logics are implemented using a wrapper class; calculated/transformed values are displayed in the UI.
- Changes to a form are reflected in the UI in real time.
- Calculation and data transformation require reference data (e.g. lookup tables) loaded from a database (e.g. MongoDB).
