## 2. Common pitfalls
- Insufficient software requirement documents
  - App data structure
    - Overall app data structure (one-to-many mapping between a policy and an array of buildings)
    - Fields entered by a user
    - Fields acquired from internal databases
    - Fields acquired from vendor APIs
    - Field data format (date, string, number, etc.)
  - UI design (usually in Excel or PPT)
    - Page layout
    - Navigation rules
    - User inputs and their types (e.g. multi-choices, datepicker)
    - UI meta data (e.g. dropdown menu items)
  - Business rules
    - Math calculation
    - Reference tables
    - Workflow rules (e.g. after use makes selection X, a new dropdown menu appears)
- Absence of a product owner role
	- end users and stakeholders send <i>ad hoc</i>, unvetted requirements to developers directly
	- requirements are in conflict with each other
	- developer confusion, frequent rework and wasted development effort
- Product owner not being a subject matter expert (SME)
	- severely underestimate a project's complexity
	- requirements are vague with missing details
	- constant project scope creep
	- unrealistic development schedule
- Constant scope creep
	- no clearly defined project scope, or previously defined project scope is not observed
	- additional features keep getting added to a project and project timeline keeps extending
- Setting app delivery date before project scope is defined or requirements are created, vetted and reviewed
	- this is like scheduling a move-in date before the blueprint of a dormitory has been created or a single brick has been laid down.
	- developer has no idea what needs to be built and yet app release date has already been set
- Product owner uses wrong media on requirement communication
	- product owner uses emails, Teams chat, etc. to send <i>ad hoc</i> requests to developers.
	- impossible to track down what features have been added/removed/changed to a piece of software and why.
